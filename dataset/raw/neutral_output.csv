"I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you.",neutral
A,neutral

Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?,neutral
I don't know!,neutral
It's not like it's porn!,neutral
"This is a serious, legitimate movie.",neutral
And the nudity is really important to the story.,neutral
That's what you say about porn.,neutral
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.,neutral
Well that's true.,neutral
And I am only naked in one scene.,neutral
Plus it sounds really great.,neutral
My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.,neutral
Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.,neutral
So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.,neutral
"Hey, what's up?",neutral
"But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.",neutral
Yeah?,neutral
"I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know?",neutral
"Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me.",neutral
And what's more different than me. A guy who's,neutral
So where are we going next?,neutral
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.,neutral

You get to be the baby's father.,neutral
Everyone knows who you are.,neutral
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.,neutral
You wanna explain that?,neutral

All right.,neutral
You've got it.,neutral
Julie.,neutral
You were with Julie?,neutral
"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.",neutral
"And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.",neutral
I can't say.,neutral
I can't say because he's famous.,neutral
"Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.",neutral

Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.,neutral
You'll,neutral
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.,neutral
"And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",neutral
We'll do a quick check.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Yeah.,neutral
You must be a little uncomfortable.,neutral
"Eh, just a tad.",neutral
"You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way.",neutral
It still could last a little while longer.,neutral
If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.,neutral
"Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective.",neutral
"Well, we are ready to try anything.",neutral
"Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
"Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.",neutral
Anytime you're ready.,neutral
"Ok, ok, here we go.",neutral
"Ok, where am I talking to, here?",neutral
"I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...",neutral
Just aim for the bump.,neutral
"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.",neutral
"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.",neutral
"Oh, hi. It's Mark.",neutral
"Okay, I do.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
I really do.,neutral
"Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab.",neutral

"Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...",neutral
"Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.",neutral
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?,neutral
"Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.",neutral
I said no.,neutral
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.,neutral
"Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.",neutral
That's okay.,neutral
"She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so",neutral
Okay. Wait! Wait!,neutral
Emily.,neutral
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.",neutral
Jen.,neutral

What?,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Aren't you gonna go?,neutral
No. Thank you.,neutral
"No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.",neutral

"No, y'know what don't close it  'cause the... keys...are in there.",neutral
What's going on?,neutral
I promise.,neutral
"Although, don't feel like you can't visit.",neutral
"Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?",neutral
"No, no he's not.",neutral
"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.",neutral
"Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.",neutral
"Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe",neutral
"Hey, what are you doing here?",neutral
"Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of",neutral
"Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.",neutral

"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?",neutral
"Okay, maybe ask this guy.",neutral
"Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.",neutral
"Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is",neutral
The,neutral
"Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big",neutral
"Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?",neutral
"Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?",neutral

"Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.",neutral
"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?",neutral
You,neutral
Where are you Vic?,neutral
But I won't have aged at all.,neutral
"So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.",neutral
Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is,neutral
"See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on",neutral
"What song was that, Pheebs?",neutral
Nope.,neutral
"No, it's been three nights in a row.",neutral
"Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.",neutral
"Oh, okay that explains it.",neutral
"I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum.",neutral
"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?",neutral
"Yeah, I know but",neutral
"Oh no-no-no, I'm there.",neutral
"No-no, stay right there.  Gettin' closer.",neutral
"Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,",neutral
"Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.",neutral
"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",neutral
"Yeah, hero sandwiches.",neutral
Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.,neutral

"Oh, I know.  Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda",neutral
"Oh, me too.",neutral
"Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"That proposal, at the planetarium",neutral
"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out.",neutral
"It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.",neutral
"Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.",neutral
"It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night",neutral
Goodnight,neutral
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?,neutral
I will think about it.,neutral
That's all I'm askin',neutral
"No it isn't, I ate that.",neutral
Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.,neutral

"You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job.",neutral
"Although, I might need some convincing.",neutral
"Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I!drank the last of the milk.",neutral
"Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.",neutral
"Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back!",neutral
Okay?,neutral
"You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?",neutral
"I will, I will find him.",neutral
Do you guys know any cute guys?,neutral
"Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go",neutral
What's the charity?,neutral
"I don't know, something either trees or disease-Ralph mumbles a lot.",neutral
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?,neutral
"Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?",neutral
What are you guys doing later?,neutral
"Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.",neutral
I want to see what he wants first.,neutral
We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.,neutral
"Thanks for having me over, you guys.",neutral
Tag?,neutral
"Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk.",neutral
"Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?",neutral
Colorado.,neutral
"Ah, what good are you.",neutral
"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.",neutral
Okay.,neutral
It-y'know what?,neutral
"Um, I'm not.",neutral
"See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.",neutral
"Yeah, me too.",neutral
My chair heals itself.,neutral
G-sharp.,neutral
G,neutral

"Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?",neutral
Okay.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Y'know what?,neutral
"If you want to, we can do it one more time.",neutral
I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that.,neutral
"In fact, I have some time right now.",neutral
Oh sure.,neutral
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
Hmph.,neutral
"So it's kinda like, you're, you know.",neutral
You said...,neutral
I said ',neutral
"I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?",neutral
"I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?",neutral
"No, I know.",neutral
"I know, because you're not in that place.",neutral
"Which would be fine, except you totally are.",neutral
"Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.",neutral
Okay?,neutral
What do they put something in the water in this place?,neutral
"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.",neutral
"Yeah, exactly.",neutral
Right.  Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.,neutral
You don't have a,neutral
"Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax",neutral
"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.",neutral
Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?,neutral
"Oh, well... Maybe we could...",neutral
"Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank.",neutral
"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year.",neutral
I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.,neutral
"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?",neutral
No. Have you seen David?,neutral
"No, no, he hasn't been around.",neutral
"Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.",neutral
Minsk. It's in Russia.,neutral
I know where Minsk is.,neutral
"So when, when do you leave?",neutral
January first,neutral
"Yes. Yes! Please, come in.",neutral
"Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him.",neutral
He had C.H.E.E.S.E.,neutral
"Well, why don't you just get him fired?",neutral
Y'know?,neutral
There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.,neutral
Excuse me.,neutral
Joey Tribbiani.,neutral
The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T.,neutral
The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.,neutral
"It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.",neutral
"Look, we've always talked about having babies someday.",neutral
"I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it.",neutral
We're good.,neutral
"He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda.""  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?",neutral
What did you say to him?,neutral
"Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.",neutral
"Oh yeah, sure.",neutral
And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.,neutral
Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?,neutral
How do,neutral
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!,neutral
"No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.",neutral
"How we doing, you guys ready?",neutral
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?,neutral
Some days it's all I can think about.,neutral
"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.",neutral
"Oh... ok, fine.",neutral
But... ehm...,neutral
"I just have one question for you,    ehm...",neutral
"When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance,    or stroll...",neutral
"Well umm, Alexandra has been",neutral
"Well, Phoebe I thought I'd--Yeah, what the hell.",neutral
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?,neutral
"No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring.",neutral
Which we can celebrate later.,neutral
Celebrate.,neutral
"Rachel, how did this happen?",neutral
Where?,neutral
At his apartment. Is this juice?,neutral
It's breast milk.,neutral
So?,neutral
"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.",neutral
You won't even taste it?,neutral
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?,neutral
"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.",neutral
How's the hair?,neutral
"I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.",neutral
Can we see her?,neutral
Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.,neutral
Come on. It doesn't taste bad.,neutral
"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...",neutral
Exactly.,neutral
Uh huh.,neutral
"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.",neutral
"Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either.",neutral
"Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.",neutral
Regina Philange.,neutral
Well maybe it was all of your questions.,neutral
What about my questions?,neutral
"No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.",neutral
"Oh, I'll get it.",neutral
Hello.,neutral
Okay.,neutral
"No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.",neutral
"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.",neutral
"Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.",neutral
Hello.,neutral
"Sure, what's up?",neutral
Uh-huh.,neutral
"O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.",neutral
"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.",neutral
Okay. It's Emma.,neutral
Take it.,neutral
What?,neutral
It's clearly an Emma.,neutral
"Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing.",neutral
"Look, Monica",neutral
Hello Greg?,neutral
"Hi, this is Monica from the plane?",neutral
"Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together?",neutral
Say next Saturday?,neutral
"Okay, how about Sunday?",neutral
Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?,neutral
"Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.",neutral
What's a Movement class?,neutral
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.,neutral
"Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.",neutral
I am.,neutral
"Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.",neutral
"Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?",neutral
"Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.,neutral
Eh?,neutral
"All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.",neutral
"I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.",neutral
"Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.",neutral
Yeah.,neutral
"Well, what period is it from?",neutral
"Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?",neutral
"Yes, yes I do.",neutral
Did they tell you anything?,neutral
Huh?,neutral
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.,neutral
"Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?",neutral
"All right, hang on!",neutral
"Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",neutral
"No-no, wait!",neutral
"This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want.",neutral
And it,neutral
"Yeah, sweetie.",neutral
